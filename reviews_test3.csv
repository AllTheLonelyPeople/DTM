Blaine Sullivan,United States,4th March 2020,cannot reschedule our tickets, Birmingham to San Diego via Dallas Ft Worth. First they gave us a hard time and wanted to charge us more money to sit with our Mentally and physically disabled child after giving us a tongue lashing .. ultimately we didn’t have to pay and got to sit together but if they can’t accommodate disabled families without humiliation and extra cost there is a problem. Now we are having to return 7 days early from international travel due to corona virus and they are telling us we cannot reschedule our tickets because they are non refundable. We aren’t asking for a refund we are asking to return early.

John Czajka,United States,3rd March 2020,do not fall for their ploy, My wife and I went to Las Vegas to celebrate our wedding Anniversary. On the flight back home from Las Vegas to St. Louis the American Airlines Flight Attendants were soliciting passengers to apply for a Barclay Credit Card. The flight attendants| in an effort to entice passengers to apply for the card| told the passengers if they apply for the card and their respective applications is approved| they will receive bonus points that translate into 2 round-trip tickets anywhere in the continental United States with no black-out dates. Be advised that this is and not accurate at all. On 2 separate occasions we attempted to redeem our round-trip tickets only to be advised we do not have enough points. We initially tried to book a flight from St. Louis to St. Augustine Florida and were told each ticket costs 50|000 points one-was for total of 200|000 points. We then tried to book a flight from St. Louis to Chicago to attend a graduation this coming June. Again we were give the same identical story about each ticket costing 50|000 points one-way for a total of 200|00 points needed to fly to Chicago. I contacted American Airlines and was told we must have misunderstood what the flight attendant was saying. We did not misunderstand anything. American Airlines refuses to stand by the promises made by their flight attendants. So do not fall for their ploy if you fly on their airline.

R Sanyal,United States,2nd March 2020,demonstrated a welcome degree of efficiency and accommodation,American upgraded me to "first" class for the entire journey from Fargo to New York via Chicago. The plane from Fargo to Chicago was an Embraer jet with a 1-2 seating layout. I had no one in the accompanying seat. It was a smooth flight. The best part| of course| of having a seat in the front of the plane| is priority boarding| and thus access to dedicated overhead luggage bins. No inflight entertainment on this aircraft. Variety of alcoholic drinks offered repeatedly along with a basket of packaged snacks. The flight was on schedule. My connecting flight was a couple of hours away but there was a flight departing before that to New York. The gate agent placed me on standby and I made it. But now I was in economy! With time being more precious| I forgoed the later dinner first class flight. The flight I was on was packed. I had to hold on to my jacket on my lap - the overhead bins were fully stashed| and I was given a window seat though I would have preferred an aisle. Flight attendant was solicitous and we were offered a snack and drink. Again| the flight arrived on time and we disembarked rather quickly.

Kristy Clack,United States,1st March 2020,pack a hefty carry on, Cancun to Phoenix. Oddly enough we were offered money for our seats last night from Phoenix to Boise. We declined for a reason! We were moved to the very back of the flight from Cancun to Phoenix and we were the last ones off the plane. Then we were required to go through check again. We were "randomly" chosen for all our bags to be inspected| taking their own sweet time. Then strangely enough the door closed before we could board. Conveniently selling our seats to an over booked flight that had all our luggage on it. I wont ever take another flight by American Airlines. And since we were moved to the back of the plane| we had a choice of 3 beverages and pretzels. My husband asked for a Dr. Pepper and the attendant laughed and said "dont sit in the back anymore!" Thank you for showing me what an airline shouldn't do! We received hotel and restaurant vouchers to a local hotel. Upon arriving it took us 45 minutes to check in because the voucher was incorrect. We had 30 minutes to eat and with no surprise ... they give you 12.00 to spend on a menu that has very few items under 12.00. If you fly with American Airlines| pack a hefty carry on with all your essential needs inside!

Regina Smith,United States,1st March 2020,rude and a complete waste of money, Denver to Miami. I'd like to know what happened to flying first class in general? When I boarded and "tried" to sit in seat 1A it was covered in melted chocolate and then a new pillow was just laid on top of it.  I did get 2 quarters and the leftover chocolate bar I'm assuming was a "on to the next" gift. So when we asked our designated attendant for something to clean he handed us a crumpled napkin and then asked us to put our bags up before we lose out on space. I'm not a primadonna by any means but for $2500 for a ticket that is the exact same as the seats for $400 tends to annoy a person. How about America airlines wipes off their own seats before the next person? Especially during a Corona virus outbreak.

S Yerdon,United States,1st March 2020,surprised at the level of attentiveness, Rochester to Nashville via Philadelphia. American Airline employees were outstanding during our trip. We requested assistance for my mother who uses a walker and were happily surprised at the level of attentiveness and promptness received. We have flown United and Delta with identical service requests and have always had to wait for a wheelchair transfer between gates| even so much as having to find our own wheelchair. From ticketing to boarding and transfers an American employee was there. To top off this trip when we arrived at our final destination the brake handle on the walker had been accidentally broken. We went to baggage services and were provided with a brand new walker (same model). This was more than we expected. I was only hoping to receive a replacement part. American Airlines has gone over and above with customer service. If you need travel assistance I highly recommend American.

For two people we just had one suitcase and we paid $30 dollars| but not just that| after they provided me the weight which was 56 lbs they said it was going to be $100 dollars more which is ridiculous| two people one suitcase that was it. I didn’t bring with us smaller suitcases for carry on inside the flight because I didn’t have| so I thought maybe will be better just one for both of us. I had to take the 6 lbs out of the suitcase.

However AA is the only airline that has flights in and out of Lynchburg Virginia. The last time I flew with them they broke my checked bag and refused to believe they broke it| they caused me to miss a flight because we sat on the Tarmac for 30 minutes after that flight already being delayed. They proceeded to tell me I should have booked a flight with a longer lay over in CLT. This is one of many times they have delayed a flight before I ever even made it to the airport.

Christian Ash,United States,25th February 2020,this airline is poor, To be honest| this airline is poor. I've flown American a few times| and tried quite hard to be understanding. But consistent delays| mismanagement| and employee incompetence paired with low quality flights and no acknowledgement from customer service or staff besides a boiler plate apology every time they screw up(which is often) has driven me to conclude that this airline is not worth your money. Take for example| my last flight. Every single one of my planes with the exception of the return trip from Ontario to Dallas had a delay| all of which took from 30 minutes to 2 hours. 2 due to an utter lack of any communication between staff. They did gate changes with very little notification almost causing some to miss their flights. They boarded planes that had preexisting maintenance problems which caused a severe delay| and their staff are incredibly surly| careless| and disinterested with very few exceptions.

F Dominick,Canada,24th February 2020,not take customer service seriously, Ottawa to San Jose via Philadelphia. From the beginning even before my journey started I had issues. American Airlines changed my flight schedule without informing me. The departure time was the same but all the connections where different as well as the arrival time. I didn’t let that bother me since they were small changes. Once I left Canada I landed in Philadelphia at 730am. I had a 7h layover at the Philadelphia airport. 3 hours into the layover| I heard an announcement saying that the flight was delayed do to maintenance. At that point| I proceeded to the American customer service desk. A gentleman greeted me asking what the problem was. I started explaining that my flight was delayed and it might have an impact on my connecting flights. In addition| I was meeting a friend in Costa Rica and it was important I arrive on January 21st. He looked at my itinerary and informed me that I will need to stay the night in Philadelphia and leave for Costa Rica in the morning| since I would not be able to make my connection flight from Miami To Costa Rica. I was floored! He had no empathy for my situation. At that point| I started talking to one of his coworkers and she started digging into additional solutions. She managed to book me a flight with two connections but it was going to be a close call. I took what she gave me and thanked her! Running to my connections was not easy but I was able to make all the flights and arrive at my destination on time. Looking back at this| I can’t believe one of the American Airline employees tried to take the easy way out and keep me overnight. Upon my arrival I see no bags. I had to wait in San Jose for a day for my bags. No apologies or compensation were provided by the airline.  All in all I would give American Airline two thumbs down| a 0/10. This airline does not take customer service seriously and when you need help they will do the bare minimum to help.

K Berden,United States,23rd February 2020,It was horrible!, Lexington to Charlotte. I had a truly horrible experience with AA a few weeks ago. I was flying economy| so was at the back of the plane. I asked if this could be changed because I have a migraine disability and being near the engine noise exacerbates this condition. I was told no at ticketing| but told it could be possible at the gate. My father's funeral was the previous day| and I was with my son| so I forgot about asking at the gate. once I got on the plane| I tried to speak with the stewardess about the situation. I have never been treated so aggressively rudely in my life. She made it very clear that I was a nuisance from the beginning. We ended up stuck on the runway for two hours because it was Sunday and they had to call in a crew (they weren't already at the airport) to remove a plane blocking the runway with a flat tire. I tried to explain to the stewardess about my disability and asked if I could sit in one of the many empty seats at the front| in order to alleviate the extra noise and heat of sitting in the back--triggers for the disease. She yelled at me| created a scene| refused to respond when I pushed the overhead button so that I could get rid of the needle and syringe I had to use because of the stress her behavior caused me. After two hours of sitting on the tarmac| we taxied back to the gate and I was removed for being "disruptive". I couldn't believe it! Because of this aggressive| nasty| devoid-of-compassion stewardess| I was seven extra hours en-route to my destination! When I complained to the airlines| they basically said "too bad". If the stewardess doesn't like you| they can label you "disruptive" and have you removed! Was she taking something out on me? Was it bad day for her (consider my situation with my father)? I have no idea| and the Airlines refused to take responsibility! I will do my utmost never to fly with company again because of this women.

Marty B Buddenbohn,United States,20th February 2020,awful service with American, Knoxville to Charlotte. For starters this has to be the smallest plane. A full grown child would have difficulty being comfortable. The main reason for my review is the awful service with American. This is not my first time flying with AA and each time it is always a nightmare. Unfortunately| to get from A to B there is no other option. You would think after the recent incident last year and being in the news with physically removing a person from the plane that there would be efforts and strides to improve their service. I have not found this to be the case. In my most recent incident| we are running on a delay leaving very little to no time to catch my connecting flight. While still sitting on the tarmac I politely asked the stewardess if I could move to one of the many empty seats ahead of me in an effort to deplane faster and hopefully make my connecting flight. Her response was of| well| those seats cost extra money and no you cannot move. Now| mind you we're fully planed and sitting here. She goes onto say| if you miss your flight I'm sure they'll reschedule you for another flight. Really? That's your answer.

P Snyder,United States,18th February 2020,humiliated and blamed,Chicago to Salt Lake City. Horrible customer service! The only reason I am flying this airline is that they have a tie-up with Qatar Airways.

After my international flight from Qatar| I asked American Airlines twice to change my boarding pass to an American Airlines one| but was said that I do not need to as I already have seat assigned. Despite that while boarding| the attendant screamed that my ticket is not scanning because I do not have seat assigned. After showing her that it is in fact assigned| she just screamed: "Well it changed".

Katherine Ohara,United States,17th February 2020,never flying American again, Worst experience of my life. I understand the airline does not control the weather; however| American can certainly control my experience and they fell short in every way. First| the American employees at DC airport were unprofessional| rude| and not knowledgeable. The communication re: status of our delayed/canceled flights was nonexistent and when they did communicate| it was always inaccurate information. A staff member literally walked away in the middle of “helping me” trying to get on standby for a flight to Nashville| stating to his coworker “what’s the point| the flight is full and there’s already 5 people on standby in front of her” and stormed off with not a word said to me. I could go on for hours about the incredibly rude American Airlines staff at the DC airport but I would run out of characters. 2nd| due to our canceled flight and the weather| AA was not able to get us a flight to our destination of Nashville but instead was only able to get us on a flight to an airport 120 miles way from our original airport destination| causing us the need to rent a car for $200 and drive 2 hours. For myself and my fiancé both being loyal AA flyers| AA advantage members| and AA barclay credit card holders| you would think at the very least AA would comp us the cost of the rental car for not getting us to our destination. Instead I was met with “no it’s not our fault.” Then| our original flight we were 1st class &our flight we got changed to we were coach. Again| no compensation. To top it all off| they lost my fiancee's checked luggage. Again| I am well aware the airline does not control the weather but I expected so much more from them and they dropped the ball every step of the way. When we get home from this vacation my fiancé and I will both be canceling our AA barclay credit cards and never flying American again after this experience.,None,Couple Leisure,First Class,Providence to Nashville,February 2020,1,1,1,1,None,1,1,1,no
C James,Canada,17th February 2020,will never be flying American again,Toronto to Dallas via Guadalajara. If I could give American Airlines 0 stars I would. We arrived to Toronto early to ensure we made our 6:30 AM flight. We were stuck on the tarmac for deicing| we thought this was no big deal and we took off. Midflight in we realized we might miss our flight to Guadalajara. In flight| they had no information about connecting flights| which I have experienced on other airlines. Upon landing in Dallas we learned we in fact missed our flight and were directed to customer service. At this point we were told to call a number whilst in line| however| they told us that we should go to the counter anyway so that was a waste of a phone call. We get to the counter and they put us on standby for a flight out later that evening and booked us on a flight for the following day guaranteed. We asked about a hotel voucher because it appeared we were delayed due to waiting for deicing in Toronto. However| we were told that it was due to "long lines at U.S customs". We do not believe this as the flight door did close at the scheduled time. We wait for hours in Dallas and make it to the gate. We were told the flight was full| but they would have more information after boarding. Midway through boarding| we were informed there was a mechanical issue with the plane| everyone had to migrate to another terminal to grab another plane. The boarding process began again. When it came to standby everyone got on except for myself and my husband as there was only one seat left. My husband became visibly upset and they just stared at us with "we just need a yes or no". We get that it is beyond our control| but we just wanted some compassion. We were rudely directed back to customer service. We went and pleaded for a hotel voucher and were just given a blank stare and once again told there is nothing the airline can do to help us. We missed a day of our vacation and were out $200 for a hotel. All in all| the staff were not helpful and we just wished that we got an apology.

B Murben,United States,16th February 2020,never again will I fly American, Pensacola  to South Bend via Charlotte. I booked a trip to Pensacola with my niece who was turning 18. I wanted to spend time with her prior to her going to college! Didn’t think our time would be spent in airports or on the plane. On the way there we had a connecting flight to Dallas which then took us to Pensacola. We ran into flight delays| flight cancellations| missed flights| to not getting on standby flights! It was a mess to put it lightly. South Bend people were not helpful and were a bit rude. When we got to Dallas| staff was extremely unhelpful and rude. She told me that she was in the middle of something and I would have to go elsewhere. The other staff were extremely helpful and they should lead a training on customer service. Toni who worked 33d on 2-13-2020 was extremely nice as well. The rest of the workers should be fired. After spending 15 hours in airports and on a plane I didn’t have much energy to complain so I settled for a standby flight for in the morning which we didn’t catch. We ended up catching the mid afternoon flight so we lost a day and 1/2 of our vacation. On the way home our flight was delayed due to the flight crew not having enough hours so instead of 7:27 take off it was 7:50. We get to Charlotte however| our plan needed maintenance so there was yet another delay. They change us to a different plane which also needed maintenance so we got switched to a 3rd plane. This plane was from the 70’s and I prayed we would make it to South Bend. We did but never again will I fly American Airlines.

B Schreier,United States,15th February 2020,never fly with them again, Omaha to Key West via Chicago . They delayed our flight into Chicago for weather which is understandable but they told us they would hold our connecting flight to Key West from Chicago. We got to the gate and they were just closing the gate to the flight and wouldn’t let us on. It took customer service 2 hours to get us on a different flight to Fort Myers. We ended up waiting in Chicago for 6 hours for the flight. We finally get to fort Myers and they sent our luggage to key west. We call to key west and they won’t even deliver our luggage to the hotel or anything. No refund of any kind. We spent about an extra $1200 to cover the mess up. Not happy at all and will never fly with them again.,None,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Key West via Chicago ,February 2020,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,no
Blanche Mukendi,United States,14th February 2020,hellish and nightmarish experience, Nashville to Montreal via NYC / Charlotte. This is my second trip within 6 months with American Airlines and I'm disgusted. My first trip was taken in August of 2019 (same route BNA->Montreal) and between 3 aircraft issues and 5 delayed flights| which caused missed connections| what t was suppose to be a 5hr trip into a 24 hour one with delayed baggage (I received my luggage the next day after calling all night). My second time flying with this airline (I honestly don't know why they are still in business). The first flight had engine oil issues .. but they kept us in there while they fixed it. Between that and other issues| we were delayed for 3 hours while seated in the flight. Then| they reassured us that connections would not be missed| because it's winter and everyone is delayed. We made it from Nashville| TN to Charlotte| NC| missed the connection (go figure)| and put on another connection through LGA (NYC). Flight delayed (again). This time because they were waiting on the flight attendants (seems like the same sequence of excuses used 6 months ago) and when we arrived in NYC missed the connection.  I go see customer service| and they inform me that the next (and last) flight of the day| was full. But they put me on" Priority" Standby. I went to the gate 4 hours early| 2 hours before the flight| gate changed. Went to the changed gate 2 hours early and waited. When their agents arrived at the desk I explained my situation and asked them to verify if there was space| the guy at the counter told me this "You're on standby and you will be the last one to board". I told him that I understood this| but I was also placed on "Priority standby" and he replies "well| they might have told you that at the other desk| but you're not important enough to be on priority standby. There are currently 8 people who are more important and they've been placed in from of you .. you're number 8.| the last person and the flight is full| so good luck!". I bought my ticket| it was never a standby ticket. This type of ugliness and unprofessional behavior is uncalled for. In the brink of tears I waited. The flight boarded and I watched it leave without me. Went back to the desk to be given a viable solution and conveniently enough| their computers were frozen. I sat down in the area and waited (18hrs spent in the airport )| I turned around a few minutes later and They had all left.  I bought a greyhound ticket and road 8 hours into Montreal (with my checked luggage still in North Carolina). A hellish and nightmarish experience| for the second time. Shame on me for even wasting my trust on this airline. Flight attendants have horrible attitudes| agents are rude and curt| and customer service is zero help. And the cherry on top was the unmitigated gall of that agent to talk to any person the way he did to me. Take this airline at your own risk| should you want your sanity tested.

Tina Erickson,United States,14th February 2020,American refused to compensate me, Philadelphia to Orlando. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I was scheduled to fly to Orlando on 2/6 to attend the UCA High School Cheer Nationals and see my daughter (who is a Senior) compete for the final time. My flight was cancelled because the originally scheduled flight crew did not have enough flight hours left. Because American does not have a business continuity plan in place with stand-by flight crews| they had to cancel the flight. They had no other flights available forcing me to book a much more expensive flight with another airline. In turn| I missed my daughter's competition. American refused to compensate me for the added expense I had to incur because of their failure. They refused to offer me anything more than $100 voucher or 5000 points for the fact I missed my daughter's competition - they even made it sound like they were doing me a favor. What am I supposed to do with that?! That gets me nothing. They also refused to compensate me for the hotel cost for the night I lost in Orlando. I am completely unsatisfied with their handling of this situation and told them so. They just don't care. I even asked the person I spoke with if this would satisfy her and she said it would not. I do acknowledge it was a rainy day and weather delays are out of their control but we could have flown if a flight crew was available. We even boarded the plane before they cancelled the flight.

We weren’t let off the airplane until 6:30 because a plane was disabled at the gate we needed to get to. Missed my connecting flight and it was 100% the fault of the airline. Wasn’t provided with any hotel room or accommodations (the next flight they could put me on was 11 am the next morning); told they couldn’t do anything because it was put in the system that everything was weather related| which was completely false| it was because there was an airplane at our gate.

Laurie Oliver,United States,13th February 2020,avoid flying American, American Airlines is dishonest. I purchased a first class ticket from Denver to Savannah- one stop in Charlotte. Getting there| while hardly a first class experience was adequate. The return flight was another story. American booked the connection from Savannah to Charlotte too close to the Denver connection| and due to their known incompetence| sat on the tarmac while my flight to Denver left. The next flight was a 3.5 hour wait in a jammed airport| and the extremely rude customer service agent informed me that there were no 1st class seats to accomodate the Denver route (longest leg of the flight). So| not only did they overbook| but they were unwilling to work on getting me the seat I had paid for| a month before the trip. The only seats left were middle row rear. Incompetent. The first class round trip ticket was $683. l was refunded a total of $110. for the error on their part- this was for the downgrade only. Now| l'm not a genuis| but 110. for the longest leg is absurd- the American Eagle rattletrap that got us from Savannah to Charlotte offered a bag of chips and| if desired| a drink- that's their "first class".

B Torweski,United States,8th February 2020,Never flying with them again, Washington to Phoenix. American Airlines hires the most unprofessional people. It seems like every encounter with anyone who works at American is hostile.

Olsi Odobashi,United States,7th February 2020,getting progressively worse, Chicago to Los Angeles. Generally the inflight service they provide is pretty great. Friendly flight attendants| good meals| etc. The problems crop up before or after the flight. Starting with the ticket purchase process - at some point I was able to choose the seat when purchasing even the cheapest tickets| but that's not the case anymore. Now you can pay more upfront to get the seat option| pay for an "upgrade" while checking in| or just get assigned a random seat after check in.  I've almost exclusively flown American since moving to the US| and one thing that happens pretty consistently is baggage space. When boarding almost every flight| they will announce the overhead bins are full so passengers (in the last few groups) are either "forced" to check-in their carryons or use bins from 5 rows behind their seat| thus blocking the (ridiculously narrow) path and making the boarding process even more chaotic than it already is. And lastly| the reason I even took the effort to write this| customer support (or lack of). If you ever need to call AA for anything| be prepared to speak Robot in order to navigate its futuristic AI conversation engine. And it may seem like it's meant to keep you from speaking to an actual human| but at least it accepts voice input| and what more can I ask from my airline of choice? I don't really know if any of this applies to other airlines as well| but it feels like the service they provide is getting progressively worse!

The rule is door closes 10 min before departure. The plane had already pushed back. The gate team tried to explain that their policy is to close 15 min early vs AAs standard. Given that the flight had pushed back| even their statement seems unbelievable. I am a silver on Delta and they called me when I was running late in Philly. Similar situation. Exhausted with AA.

S Hakinsey,United States,29th January 2020,lost my trust on American Airlines, Charlotte to San Francisco. American Airlines caused me to stay at the airport overnight to wait for the next flight. My first flight to LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) was delayed multiple times| totaling 1 hour of wait. Then| the plane take off was delayed by 30 minutes. All of this made my connection to SFO tighter.

Even more| after I flew and got off the second| rescheduled flight| I found out my bag was put in another plane arriving in SFO at a later time| which meant 2 hours of bag delay. All these troubles totally messed up my arrival schedule and plans| and I lost my trust on American Airlines (AA) as this is the second time it is happening.

One of the worst travel experiences in 45 years:  Atrocious customer service from start to finish.  Inept| rude| and unresponsive management that avoids responsibility for poor service| which is mirrored by unsupported front line personnel| translating to a company that simply doesn’t care.  Delays of more than 4 hours for a 2 hour flight with no weather/disaster excuse... is inexcusable. Management knew| yet kept everyone (50 people ages 4 months-84 years) waiting with consecutive delays totaling 4 hours before cancelling flight....at 1 AM in the morning| leaving us stranded in the middle of the night with very limited rebook options within the next 12 hours.

Every time I fly them something happens .. delays| cancellations| rude employees. This latest event happened when a flight from Charlotte was delayed due to air traffic at the Charlotte airport we were headed to. We left 30 mins late and then circled the Charlotte airport for another extra 15 mins. More than half the plane missed their connections. When I finally got off my commuter plane I ran (a mile it seemed) to catch my connection. I had 15 mins before it was due to take off. I arrived at the gate to find they had closed the flight (plane still there) and I wouldn't be allowed to board. I asked them why they didn't hold the plane knowing I was a delayed flight. I was told that no one contacted them to tell them to hold it. WTF! I'm so tired of American having. No regard for travelers plans. This doesn't happen with other airlines!

When I got back home I called customer service and it took three different times of me calling to get them to give me some kind of compensation. They kept on giving me a phone number to call them back that did NOT work. Finally they gave me a $250 voucher that expires in a year.

T Broussard,United States,20th January 2020,really needs to do better, Los Angeles to Syracuse via Charlotte. There is always an issue when you fly with American Airlines! Since my son’s initial flight at LAX is delayed| he will definitely miss his connecting flight at ORD. Therefore he will most likely miss the important event he was trying to attend in the first place. When my son asked for an alternate flight| he was not even helped at American Airlines customer service; instead he was given a phone number to call and make the new travel arrangements himself. When he called| the service representative told him he would have to wait overnight and take a flight out 24 hours later. These flights that we have previously paid for months in advance| are usually cancelled or postponed| especially on the return flights. It definitely seems like false advertisement when an airline promotes and sells seats on flights for specific dates and times| and then cancel| only so they can cram as many passengers together on one plane as possible. And to make matters worse| my son’s luggage has been loaded on the plane that he cannot even take. We are “told” that he can pick up his luggage when he eventually arrives at his destination| whenever and wherever that is!

I got to spent a full 5+ hours with someones head in my lap as she left the seat reclined even when not sleeping; and had to be prompted to put in in the landing position! The leg room situation was a joke; no space at all. The seat was probably a bit wider; a good thing because I had to sit sideways to clear the magazines.

We did our best to make it work and at the check in kiosk it didn't allow an option to check back .. apparently we missed the 45 minute limit by a minute. The rude attendant by the time we got her attention said there was nothing she could do we needed to hope we could rebook a later flight. Later we found out this was not true and the attendants at the desk could have checked our luggage up to 30 minutes before which she did not tell us. I ran up to the airport store bought a carry on bag| through what we could in| ran suitcase back to car| and ran to gate as fast as you can with a 6 and 8 year old. As we got there they told us we could not board and the plane was gone .. although it could be clearly seen outside the window. On top of that was the continued most unfriendly customer service experience i've been through in years......couldn't care less and you were lucky they would acknowledge you. Luckily they found us another flight ... 12 hours later and charged us an additional $300 to save those seats.

Airline was late to arrive at airport - due to mechanical issues .. seems to be a very common occurrence as it has happened several times in the last 12 months. After departure we flew for 2 hours to reach the destination only to be told that they could not land due to weather. So they routed us back to the origination. Yes another 2 hours.

Then I was 3 pounds overweight on my check in bag and they charged me an additional $100 on top of the $30 that I paid to check it in the first place.

On the original part of the trip| this same thing occurred leaving Dallas to Salt Lake and we were two hours delayed| but that crew was able to switch planes with us. I will never fly American again.

L Thompson,Switzerland,7th January 2020,They will not seat you with your family or friends,First| I would like to make note of the flight attendants. We had two really great and humorous flight attendants who did what they could to make our interactions enjoyable. However| I will avoid flying with this airline in the future for the following reasons: 1) Seating. They will not seat you with your family or friends unless you purchased this option. You will likely be separated from them| even if you purchased tickets at the same time. 2) No online check-in. Despite the terms saying that you can check-in online 24 hours prior to flying (where you supposedly can arrange seats on international flights)| this is not allowed for international flights. I attempted to log-in multiple times the day before flying and calling the airline| but wait times were over an hour. I spoke to other passengers who also were unable to check-in online before the flight and this experience was the same. 3) The food is not good. I ordered the Asian-vegetarian meal in advance which normally means on the Atlantic US flights that you'll get Indian food. The rice was undercooked and it was so incredibly spicy my stomach hurt. 4) The flight attendants weren't working. Despite my positive interactions with the flight attendants| I saw them taking a lot of breaks. The airline had blocked the entire back middle row (4 seats across). I understand they need breaks| however| I have never seen flight attendants reading and watching films. Shouldn't these seats be available to the passengers? Not once did I see them walking around offering beverages during the pauses in between meals. 5) The seats are awful. I got stuck in the seat in front of the bathroom on the side. This seat barely reclines and the seat in front of me was broken and the woman left her seat reclined the entire time| so I was unable to properly view the screen or have much space to move.,None,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to London via Los Angeles,January 2020,2,2,3,2,3,1,None,2,no

They couldn’t give us a voucher for another flight at another airport for the same day| when we had orders to be back the same night.

S Wang,United States,5th January 2020,Worst airline experience, Worst airline experience consistently over the past years. You cannot preselect seats unless you pay for them on international flights. They randomly assign seats apart from each other when you booked the tickets together| and the only way you can get seats together before getting to the gate is to pay online for assigned seats.

So we went to the oversized baggage center and apparently when the car seat came out it was broken. Plus they didn’t put a plastic wrapping on on it.

B Lavero,United States,3rd January 2020,never felt so defeated, Phoenix to Guayaquil via Dallas. Traveling to Ecuador from Phoenix through a connection in Dallas with my husband to see my sick father in-law. First we arrived to the airport in Phoenix super early just in case there was long lines but checkin went very smooth but after that everything went wrong. As we are waiting for the flight we get multiple notifications that our flight is being delayed. After the fourth delay notification we went to customer service to see what the issue was and if we were going to make our international connection. After talking to them for a while| we found out the plane was late leaving LA due to a baggage problem and after them contacting the POC it was decided to try the flight to Dallas in hopes that for some reason the our international flight was delayed| due to the time of year| that we might be able to make it and if not we were told that they would rebook us to the next flight| which was the following night| and they would get us a hotel on them. We tried and took the delayed flight to Dallas on their recommendation. Unfortunately we missed our international flight so we went to customer service now in Dallas as we were told to do in Phoenix and were told that they were going to give us nothing! The customer service employee was the rudest| least helpful person I have every met. She said that the flight was delayed due to bad weather in Phoenix (which was not true plus we were told it was a baggage problem in LA that caused the delay) and that since it was a weather problem they are not responsible to give us anything. We explained to her what we were told in Phoenix that if we missed the flight due to their delay we would get a hotel and meal vouchers since the next flight to Ecuador was not for another 24 hours. She told us it was not her problem and that she could give us a number to call for discounted rates for a hotel or send us back to Phoenix. So now my husband and I are stuck in Dallas for 24 hours with nothing. Not even our bags because since our final destination was not Dallas the bags were put in a storage room to be put on the Ecuador flight the next evening. We left the terminal basically in tears because we dont have any money for a hotel or anything because we have been scraping and saving money for this trip. We went to the baggage people to see if by chance we could get our bags to at least change clothes or brush our teeth since everything was in our checked bags. The workers there were very nice and said that is was not right and sent us to another person who eventually gave us a hotel and meal voucher. Our flight from Phoenix landed at 6:00pm. The missed flight to Ecuador took off at 5:35pm. By the time anything got resolved and after being sent to different people| we got a hotel at 1:00am. The other people we talked to| baggage claim and eventually upper management were all very nice and understanding| but Charo| who's title is customer service was less then worthless and rude. All we wanted was what were we told we would get after taking their recommendation to still take that flight instead of being rerouted another way. And to be told that it was not her problem after paying $2000.00 for this trip to now missing a flight due to their delay and missing an entire day with an ailing family member; I have never felt so defeated and just lied too.,None,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Guayaquil via Dallas,December 2019,1,1,3,3,3,1,None,1,no
H Laure,United States,3rd January 2020,I am done with this airline, So after a mistake that AA made after a canceled flight| I was given a travel voucher to refund my money (only have about 10 hours of contacting customer service).

When we walked to checkin it was too confusing. There were kiosks where you would get the tags to your bag then there was bag drop. None of it made sense. We had a problem where our tickets were booked separately and we had 6 bags for five people which is pretty good for my family we could only check 5 for some dumb reason. We took about an hour figuring this out then got to security for 15 minutes then got to our gate| when we got there we had a stroller for the baby and the staff were confusing us on what to do even when knew what to do.

Charlie Castille,United States,28th December 2019,felt so disrespected,New York to Paris. My American Airline's flight has been completely awful up to this point and it hasn't been a few hours into our flight. Leading with boarding issues originating from delays. Which was reasonable in light of the fact that it had to do with the weather yet when I asked one of the workers posing a basic question about what time until are next flight which they answered with "I don't know" and returned to what they were doing. After at long last getting onto the plane I genuinely saw the absence of client assistance this spot advertised. Asking help with modifying my seat since it wasn't working and having them blow up and give me a grimy look was something totally uncalled for. There were more occasions that I've felt affronted on this flight yet I won't name everything. Despite the fact that I understand the weather is out their control I felt as though they indicated almost no consideration towards others. Never have I at any point felt so disrespected by a whole group and hence I without a doubt will not be flying American Airlines until the end of time.,None,Business,Economy Class,New York to Paris,December 2019,1,3,1,2,3,1,1,3,no
Tyler Landals,United States,27th December 2019,not acceptable at all,Dallas to Des Moines. I arrived in Dallas at 12pm my flight to Des Moines was suppose to depart at 3:20pm| at 2:59pm they tell us are gate is switched| we go to that gate and then tell us we are departing at 4:21pm. Then they make us switch gates again and don’t board until 4:30pm. We finally get to board and then someone puts the wrong fuel into our plan so we have to wait for them to empty out the fuel and put new fuel in. Then they say we are good to go| right when we start moving than they say that something is wrong with the door and we have to wait for someone to come fix the door. This is definitely the worst airline I have ever flown on and it is very very annoying for this. I would never and I mean never recommend American Airlines to anyone. Horrible airline. They seriously need to step it up and give refunds out or close down. I have been at an airport all day is this stuff does not help.

The employee directed me out line for “main customer service” to a priority automated kiosk and told me to go to that counter if it didn’t work. I proceeded to do as I was told by the employee. After the automated machine still didn’t work I went to the priority counter which directed me to the counter next to them| who when I got to that counter directed me to the original counter I was in line with. When I got to the front of that line I was told I was no longer able to check in due to time being too close to the take off time by 5 minutes. I was deceived by multiple American Airlines employees who sent me to multiple counters and forced me to miss my flight by giving me false information.

M Galena,United States,24th December 2019,very poor business class experience, Cancun to Philadelphia. A few months ago I flew AA business and I was hoping to get the same positive experience on this flight but that was not the case. Flying on this aircraft was a novelty experience and that is why I booked it. AA will be retiring the Boeing 767 soon. The business cabin was comfortable and the single window seat was great. AA just keeps getting service wrong. The pre-flight beverage was a plastic cup of water. First time on business I’m not asked what I wanted to drink pre flight. Once up in the air| snack and food was all served immediately. I went for the chicken option and it was ok. The business cabin only had 6 passengers and that included me| however the crew was just going thru the motions and although the job was done there was no interaction whatsoever. Long faces and no eye contact or follow up after service for the entire 4hr flight. WIFI only worked towards the end of the flight| we had the old school screens attached to the ceiling and no headphones where offered.

My wife and I each fly probably 10 or more times a year on average for work and vacation and we try to avoid American Airlines like it’s a plague. At least 8 out of 10 times we have flown American| our flights have been delayed or cancelled| or they schedule very short layovers and their delays cause you to miss your connection. This morning they just cancelled our connecting flight. Then| as usual| blamed it on weather (othere’s not a cloud in the sky at either airport). Then the delays and cancelations force you to deal with their terrible customer service| I will not even get in to that| it’s a whole other review on its own| and there are plenty out there already. Bottom line| if this company wasn’t a borderline monopoly then they’d be on their way out of business already.

Robert Kuzlik,United States,22nd December 2019,I had nothing but problems, I had nothing but problems with American Airlines. We went to Miami in November. While there| we purchased new luggage. When we got home| one of the new pieces had one of the wheels  broken off. We went to baggage claims and they told us they would start a claim but did not think this one could be fixed. She was very nice and offered a replacement bag for us to get our stuff home in one piece and suggested we call when we get home. We did and at first| they told us we accepted a replacement piece so that closed the case. The brand new piece we purchased was almost $400 and they replaced it with a piece you could get on Amazon for $69. I told them this was unacceptable. She said she would have to speak with a supervisor and would get back to us the next day. I never heard back from them. So after a week| I called them back. Was told the person handling my claim was not there but took a message and said she would call back when she was in at work the next day. Again| no return phone call. I waited another week and still no call from them. I finally called them back and spoke to someone else. He also told me that I had accepted a new bag and the case was closed. I explained everything again and said that was unacceptable. He said he would talk with a manager and call me back. No return call. I called him back after a day or two and he said the manager agreed to pay for a replacement bag and he was sending me an email. In the email| it said I needed to send them a copy of the receipt. I did that right after I read their email. A few days later| I got another email saying they were sending me a check for the $389 replacement cost but had to return the bag they gave me to the airport. I drove an hour and forty minutes one way to return the bag they gave me. It took almost an hour to convince the people at the airport to accept the replacement bag back. I then had to call them again to ensure the system showed I returned it. A day later later I called again and they just sent me an email saying they were sending a check. I called again and asked why it was only for the $389 and not for the set they destroyed and what about the tax I paid. He said they do not reimburse for those things and the case was closed. I must say| if this is the way they treat customers who try to be brand loyal| I am just going to fly with whom ever is cheapest from here on out! If my loyalty means nothing to them| then I wont give it to them.

I arrived at this unorganized airport 2 hours early to my surprise flight # 1866 gate C19 while sitting there I hear one of the staff say I need everyone to go to gate B16. She was very rude and seemed to have an attitude. There were quite a few elderly people which none were offered assistance by wheelchair or any thing else. After walking this long distance. We started sitting down and I hear a gentleman say pardon the inconvenience we need every one to go to gate C24 following announcements on the loud speaker. I stopped an AA staff person to ask for wheelchair assistance for this elderly women and was told I have to find a porter! Now we start heading to the next gate which another announcement was made about the delay plane now being cleaned and will be heading over to the gate. We sat there about 10 to 15 mins enough time to finish my bagel and coffee.

We are now sitting there when the 2 female employees start calling up stand bys after stand bys Then they finally start calling group #’s up which I noticed stand by customers are boarding before me and allowed to take there rolling bags and carrying on bags. I was confused the entire time but would not express that to the staff. Then the employees now called up groups 7 -9 to check there rolling luggage in before boarding the plane. A women in front of me started to board the plane with her rolling bag and they got very nasty with her and called security. Then the female employee who was checking in bags said didn’t I announce this when I said 7-9 with carry on bags only can board the plane and rolling bags have to be checked in. I was upset due to all the gate changing| booking this unprofessional flight and now have to check my bag in after down sizing my bag in the first place| so my daughter and 1 month old grandson who I am meeting for the first time| would not have such a long wait for me! I question America Airlines unprofessionalism| the lack of empathy for the elderly and the lack of customer service from the check in staff! I will not be flying with AA anymore or booking through cheapoair anymore. These flights and all the fees attached are far too expensive to have this sort of experience. I will say going through security was the only great experience ! The TSA agents were great! But the overall experience earned from me is a 1.

H Cooper,United States,15th December 2019,a lack of heart towards families with young children,I was on work travel from the US to Spain and brought my husband and 18-month old baby with me. We had bought separate tickets on 2 consecutive days| but mine ended up being economy and my husband + baby| premium economy. Both for basically the same price for the round-trip flights ($1348.83 for economy vs $1366.16 for premium economy). When we boarded| the economy class was packed| not a seat open. However| the premium economy was practically empty| only 5 other passengers. The seat next to my husband (baby was a lap infant) was open| because the woman assigned to it quickly changed to a different seat (nodbody wants to sit next to a baby| right?). So as the seat became open| I went and sat there| and immediately the flight attendant went to get a supervisor to scold me. The two woman ganged up on me and yelled at me| accusing me of having kicked out the other lady from her seat. I thought| what are these lies? They very meanly told me to go sit at my regular seat| 20 rows back. I obeyed| but after reaching 10000 ft of altitude I communicated my situtation to another flight attendant| to see if they could understand that I am a mother who has been separated from her baby and husband. They were very mean. They again yelled at me saying that you have to pay for that class| $500 or $800 (two people told me 2 different things). How ironic that the prices we paid for these two different classes were the same! Also| I bet that| had I been their "friend" or sister| the treatment would have been different. So then my husband called the manager| and very politely conveyed our situation and asked why couldn't I be with them| if there were tons of open seats available. He first said “I hear that you’ve had an encounter with all my staff”. Ok| first off| “an encounter?” Asking questions is “an encounter”?! Second| aren't the staff there to help customers? Doesn’t American Airlines always say that they are there to serve you and make your flight great? Then he said that it was the regulation| but yet| he was willing to break the regulations by letting me take my baby with me to my seat| even though he was *not* the lap infant associated with my ticket. Oh| so we break one rule| the one about swapping seats and tickets for the child| but not the rule about moving "up" on a seating class (barely| still economy)? While this was happening| the seat belt sign was off| so I had left my seat to go see my family. The meal time also began. The two flight attendants who had previously yelled at me in a 2-against-1 scenario| now attacked me again. "Go back to your seat!" "You can't be here!". I was just visiting my family| and all of my stuff was in our shared carry-on which my husband had! They boxed me in between two carts| they made me cry. Other passengers saw all of this and invited me to come over to their seat| so that the carts could move (since the flight attendants weren't being cooperative). People who I had never seen before in my life were very sympathetic. Some later approached me and said "they were really out to get you".

Long story short I was checked in via my email since the day prior to the flight| I was at the airport 2 hours early for my flight hanging out outside so I could smoke| when I went to go through security 45 min prior to my flight. I had missed my check in time is what I was told and can't get a flight until tommorow as a "standby". Between just getting out of the marine corps and starting a new job weeks ago| having 2 kids the holidays and va appointments this was devastating to me and sw customer service treated it as if they were annoyed by me and needed to help the next customer. I will never fly American Airlines again. I managed to work a ticket getting within 2 hours of my destination through SW Airlines landing tonight but now I have to find a way to get home from there with little money.

Spent 5 more hours and an extra lay over before reaching my destination. All after plans needed to be cancelled. Customer service contact and show no accountability for ruining our overnight trip to NYC. Refused to give another ticket for our troubles or acknowledge their part. They felt a $100.00 certificate could make up for the it faulty equipment and our time. No compassion from the customer service representative.

W Varden,United States,14th December 2019,worst airline I’ve flown, Miami to Hartford. I’ve been flying 3-5 times per year for over 17 yrs and American Airlines is by far the worst airline I’ve flown. If you buy economy tickets with your significant other they can sit you in row 5 and your wife in row 9. If you ask to be sat together because you have never had that issue with any other airline they will charge $56 to sit you together.

Jae Alas,United States,13th December 2019,horrible customer service, Madrid to San Francisco via Dallas Ft Worth. On 12/2/19| my 9 yo daughter was traveling from Madrid>DFW>SFO. I get a call at 11pm PST stating that she cannot check in due to the unaccompanied minor fee not being paid. When I booked this flight it was mandatory that both unaccompanied minor fees were paid for both ways. While on the phone with the agent she confirmed both ways were paid. Unfortunately when I was sent my trip confirmation unaccompanied minor doesn’t show up on that. After receiving the phone call I immediately called the airline to fix this problem and was told that somehow the system must have dropped the unaccompanied minor for the trip back. At that time I offered to pay this fee and was told that they could not take my payment over the phone! So here I have my 9yo daughter in Spain and I can’t pay for her to get here. I suggested that this fee be waived since this was American Airlines fault| the agent also mentioned that should could not do this as well.  Thank god a stranger ended up paying for her unaccompanied minor fee at the gate in Spain. If this very generous person didn’t take care of this my child would be stuck alone in a foreign country.  My daughter gets to DFW at 1:35PM. Her next flight is scheduled to leave DFW at 4:49. After 13 delays the new time to depart is 11:05PM. 10 hours she is sitting in the airport and during this time she was not in the unaccompanied minor room| they had her sitting in the gate area alone. I had called the gate multiple times to make sure she was ok and that someone there had fed her. I was told she was fed a cookie| chips and some soda| she was NOT fed a hot meal. I then asked where she was and was told she was asleep in a chair next to the gate! My 9yo was left in the main area and not in the unaccompanied minor room where she should have been. At this point I finally get a hold of a manager who apologized for everything and took my daughter to get a hot meal and back to the UM room. (7 hours too late). In addition my daughter was mingling with people at the gate and even ate with some random family. Coco was the only amazing thing about this trip home for my daughter. No one called me to update me| no one tried to get this 9yo on another flight to another nearby airport. I looked up the other flights and plenty went out before flight 2393 I am beyond livid . Where in American Airlines mind is any of this ok. You put my child in great danger. I will never fly your airline again and will make sure others are aware of the horrible customer service with your airlines.

Kelly Stecher,United States,12th December 2019,Would not recommend American, Newark to Peoria via Chicago. Delayed out of Newark (due to weather| understandable). While boarding we were told the over head bins were full and our carry-ons now HAD to be checked. But could not be answered and confirmed as to what would happen to our suitcases if we missed our connection or switched flights. Once on board we noticed the back half the plane was hardly full and there was plenty of space for our bags. Once arrived in O'Hare we had time to make our connection. We were not allowed to deplane for over 25 mins. We ran across the terminal| once arrived at the gate of our flight home we were told the plane left| we missed it. We were sent down to customer service| there we were told our flight was gone and offered to be placed on a flight to Bloomington (55 mins away from where we live) or we had to wait until the next day to be sent to Peoria. We triple checked with the man that our luggage would be sent with us on our plane. He said he put a note confirming our bags would follow| if not file a claim. While boarding for the Bloomington flight| I received text alerts informing me my original flight home has been delayed and new departure time is at 10 pm. So our flight was still in Chicago and we were being sent to a different city for NO REASON! Top it off| once we arrived in Bloomington only 1 of 3 bags made it and of course NO ONE working can be found anywhere to make a claim. We track down a luggage worker and they search the numbers| our bags were sent to the Peoria flight scheduled for the next day! Not only did we have to schedule a different ride to take us home 1 hr at midnight| when our flight home that we "missed" arrived in Peoria at 11pm. Now we have to take off work the next day to go pick up our luggage from the Peoria airport because they sent it to the wrong flight! Worst part| throughout this process we couldn't find anyone to help us and if we did they didn't/ couldn't give us actual answers!

Charles Shipley,United States,8th December 2019,denied any responsibility,Philadelphia to Denver. My husband and I were returning from Italy and had a 6 hr layover in Philadelphia. When we boarded the plane at 1900 our flight was delayed for 2 hours. The pilot told us to get off and we would board again about 1/2 hour. I noticed a large line forming in front of customer service and noticed an email informing me our flight had been cancelled. My husband got in line. I got on the phone to try to get us tickets. After 45 min on hold| I reached a representative. She could not find a departing flight available from Philadelphia for days but told me if we could get to Baltimore by 6am there was a flight leaving at 8 am. We agreed and just as she was getting our information the call was interrupted by an automated message asking if I would work with that representative again. I was then thanked and the call was ended without tickets. I called AA again while I was in line and in 45 min I was on the line again with a representative. I explained that my husband had gotten frustrated with what had become over a two-hour wait to get a flight home and had purchased a returning flight through Delta Airlines the next morning. I asked her if she could book us on a different airline and she said that there were no flights available. I asked her if we should cancel the flights that we have booked through Delta so that she could book those flights through Delta for us and she said there was no way that she could guarantee that she could get those tickets if we canceled them and that we should just keep those tickets and get a refund on those Delta tickets from AA. I asked her if she could get us a hotel. She said there was really nothing else she could do. As we were exiting the terminal to get our checked bags visiting with some of the other passengers we were told that they were given hotel vouchers for a nearby hotel. We decided to return to the customer service people and see if we could get a room as well but no one was there. When we returned to Denver I contacted customer service who told me that I needed to reach out to refunds. Refunds told me that since I had booked my flight through Iberia and my husband had booked his flight through British Airways that we would need to contact them. My husband and I contacted above-mentioned airways who emailed us back denying any responsibility and putting the responsibility back on American Airlines. I contacted American Airlines again and they said that we should contact cheap o air where we had originally booked the flights. We contacted cheapo air and they denied any responsibility as it was American Airlines problem. I reached out to refunds again and was told that I needed to contact customer service. I contacted customer service and spoke with a woman who said that she would get this resolved and contact us within two days. She never returned our call and I could not reach her with just her first name when I called back. I was told again that I had contacted the wrong department and that I needed to reach out to refunds. I probably have close to 30 hours into trying to resolve this problem. I am not quite sure where to turn at this point. It is highly unlikely that I will ever choose to fly on American Airlines again.,None,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Philadelphia to Denver,June 2019,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,no
A Rex,United States,8th December 2019,now I am stuck in a hotel, Buffalo to Cancun via Philadelphia.

Had 5mins to get through customs and heard the flight to Buffalo| NY was about to close the gates. After running with my military service connected knee and back conditions. And after asking for a ride by an attendant| which we were denied| made to the gate on time. However| the airlines sold our seats to someone else| even though we made it on time.

E Garmann,United States,8th December 2019,Extremely disappointed, Los Angeles to Boston via Philadelphia. Extremely disappointed| mainly by the crew. When we were first at the gate| the gate agent made us put our bags in the bag sizer to check if they fit| which was fine. However we had 2 of the same exact suitcase| one of which had a backpack and jacket on top. We briefly explained that it was the same suitcase and it would be too much of a hassle to put it in the bag sizer and began to leave. As we were walking down the jet bridge| she was saying "It won't fit. When we got on the plane| the greeter kept saying 'good morning' to everyone| despite it being 11pm. While passengers were trying to sleep (because it was a redeye) crew were talking about their life and other nonsense. When I confronted them about this| they rudely stated 'We're working'. They did not bring drinks when passengers woke up| which would have been nice on a 5 hr flight. Only tolerable part was the legroom.

S Neal,United States,5th December 2019,I will never fly them again, This was the worst flying experience I’ve ever had. I understand bad weather happens| but the way this airline handled their problem was unacceptable and offensive to me and likely all the others that AA stuck with the bills that were “complimentary”. I was in NYC getting 2nd opinions on recurrent stage 4 cancer. The weather got bad on my way back home and our plane never left runway. We were all bussed back to the airport and shoves in a small room as they tried to figure out alternate routes. It was disappointing they couldn’t get me home until 11pm the following night due to both NYC airports shutting down so it was a mess. The nice man at the rebooking booth knew it was way too long for someone in my condition to wait it out in an airport as it would be almost 24 hours. He offered me a food credit| 2 shuttle credits| and 2 nights at a hotel he told me was within 2 miles if LaGuardia. Food credit worked great and I got food before I left for the shuttle. I then waited outside in the pouring rain as the shuttle just wasn’t coming even after an hour. Finally I see it and make sure to get on first. It was at that time the driver asked to see the credit and he said okay hop in. Let’s get you to the Bronx! The Bronx I said? It’s true they booked all of use in the hurtle in a Comfort Inn in the Bronx much further than 2 miles. I was just happy to be going to a room as I was beginning to feel weak and tired. I hopped off the bus first and ran in when we got there. This was pure intuition. I walk in and explain and show my vouchers only to be told they don’t take airline vouchers as the rest of the entire shuttle lines up behind me. She called 3 managers on speaker phone and they all said they don’t take them Nor were they notified by American Airlines. So it’s storming and this lobby is full of upset people. They were about to get more upset when the woman tells us all they only have 3 rooms total available for everyone and you must pay for it. I paid for that night and the next day since they refused to take my two vouchers and the next day as my flight was 10pm. It was $175 a night. The next day they end up changing my flight twice so I could longer use my voucher for the shuttle as they didn’t allow me enough time with the last second flight change to sooner take off. Now I had to pay $43 for an uber ride to the airport because they moved the flight back up last second to try and get out before a storm. I did all of this as I had no help and no choice. I explained all of this in detail with proof and there must have been others report this as we had a full large shuttle with people that got no room at all. I provided receipts. They can verify it all. I spent nearly $400 all because of them. They refused to refund anything for months and then send a $143.00 check which I still am unsure where that number came from. I called and they told me to go to the airport as thats the only way to be refunded. I did this and they said no refunds are processed at the airport and to go home and email them. I did that too. Nothing. Very sad for such a large accomplished airline. It’s sad because I fly them often and use an associated credit card. I will never fly them again unless necessary. Regardless| they need to redo their customer service when it comes to the example above. Bad bad!

We waited in line for a long time| because anyone with priority or 1st class gets a special line and goes immediately ahead of all regular passengers.

Then they announced that this flight was now delayed so we were going to once again miss our connection. They would not allow me to take my carry-on onto the plane - even though other bags were bigger because mine was an actual carry-on. Hint: shopping bags| duffle bags and backpacks all bugger were allowed. Knowing that I was going to be stuck in Dallas because there was no way to make connections. I needed my bags.

Andrew Fuller,United States,4th December 2019,We re-booked with Southwest, We cancelled a "non-refundable" ticket a month and a half before our scheduled departure. We booked and paid for our flights in October 2019; We were on a budget but still wanted to take a vacation out to see a good friend in California. I had been mulling over different flights and came across one with AA which fit within our budget. The flight out had a 10 hour layover in Phoenix| and an hour layover on the way home. This was fine with us since I have another good friend who lives in Phoenix| so staying with him for a few hours seemed logical for a cheap flight (our total all together with upgraded seats was about $780 for both tickets). A month went by and I get a simple email saying that there had been a change to our itinerary| but they didn't charge us any extra money. I go to look at our new flight schedules and AA had the nerve to double our layover time to 20 hours in Phoenix and add another layover on the way home in Charlotte| with 20 minutes between landing and takeoff to change planes in Charlotte. This makes two layovers now on the trip home. All the changes meant we were literally traveling for a total of 30 hours all together (for a flight that is barely 6 hours nonstop). We had previously booked and paid for lodging in Oakland for our flight in| and with the new itinerary change we would have been forced to cancel. I was finally fed up and called AA| who was very pleasant on the phone and they couldn't believe how drastically our schedule was changed and assured a full refund (which I have received).

I was upset and didn't know how or when to schedule my return trip.

He then told me my flight back was only worth $118 and my new ticket would be around $660 (a 1 way ticket!) so the difference left for me to pay would be around $550 to get back home. I didn't have that much money and I don't understand how they could say my first ticket| the return trip home| was worth so little. Needless to say| this was very upsetting| considering the grief I was already going through. Thank God| Spirit Airlines saved me with a much cheaper ticket to get me home. I will never fly with AA again.,None,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Charlotte,November 2019,1,3,4,3,None,1,None,1,no
Sara Smith,United States,27th November 2019,I had to check my bag in, Seattle to Los Angeles. This is the worst airline ever. I had to check my bag in because there was not enough storage when in fact there is so much storage on this plane. We have been waiting at the gate to take off for an hour now. Everything about this airline sucks. I was supposed to be in LA by 1 but looks like I will be home by 3 pm. ,None,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,November 2019,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Harold Crowe,United States,26th November 2019,flight today was outstanding, Atlanta to Chicago. I have to write in for American Airlines my flight today was outstanding.

I have flown many Airlines and must say I have had extremely good service to exceptional today the flight was smooth flight attendants did a great job today. I am not sure if they hear that enough and want you to know thank you I look forward to flights on American Airlines in the future.,Boeing 737,Family Leisure,First Class,Atlanta to Chicago,November 2019,10,5,5,5,5,5,None,5,yes
Ray Desimone,United States,25th November 2019,no regard for customer service, LaGuardia to Miami via Aruba. After boarding plane were asked to get off stating fuel door issue. After the 2 hour delay we take off and miss our connecting flight in Miami by 15 minutes to Aruba where vacation is planned. We then book the flight for next morning and figure well stay in Miami for the day and overnight. We find out our luggage is getting held for next days flight or we can wait 2 to 8 hours in airport until they find it. Then| they give us a free night at the Miami airport hotel which was for lack of a better term| horrendous (rather than in our paid for hotel in Aruba). They were nice enough to give us food vouchers for $12 per person in total. Considering we had wait 20 hours this was the final slap in the face and didn't even cover breakfast. I understand problems| delays etc but the way they handle this situation is nothing but corporate greed and no regard for customer service.,None,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LaGuardia to Miami via Aruba,November 2019,4,4,5,3,5,4,5,4,no
D Berwin,United States,25th November 2019,they had over sold premium economy, San Francisco to Barcelona via New York. My wife and I were bumped from premium economy to standard economy. The reason was they had over sold premium economy. Because this occurred halfway to our destination I felt trapped by this sudden change and had to accept the smaller seats or lose our prepaid lodging and tours in Barcelona. We originally choose premium economy because my wife has been reluctant to travel if she has to be confined in a small economy seat. It now looks like the airlines actions are going to limit my travel. What other businesses can get away with selling a product or service and then change it at the last minute solely for their benefit?,None,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Barcelona via New York,November 2019,3,1,4,None,None,1,None,2,no
Alrica Evans,United States,25th November 2019,charged an extra fee for my bag, San Antonio to Houston. I will never fly this airline again. I was let through to the boarding gate| my carry on was fine until I was boarding. Then I was charged an extra fee for my bag. I was refused my purse with my medication. I was treated with complete disrespect and rudeness. Just because I was at the terminal and I was flying economy. I was treated like a second class citizen.,None,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Houston,November 2019,1,1,1,None,None,1,None,1,no
