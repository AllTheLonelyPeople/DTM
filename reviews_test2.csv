Blaine Sullivan,United States,4th March 2020,cannot reschedule our tickets, Birmingham to San Diego via Dallas Ft Worth. First they gave us a hard time and wanted to charge us more money to sit with our Mentally and physically disabled child after giving us a tongue lashing .. ultimately we didn’t have to pay and got to sit together but if they can’t accommodate disabled families without humiliation and extra cost there is a problem. Now we are having to return 7 days early from international travel due to corona virus and they are telling us we cannot reschedule our tickets because they are non refundable. We aren’t asking for a refund we are asking to return early.

John Czajka,United States,3rd March 2020,do not fall for their ploy, My wife and I went to Las Vegas to celebrate our wedding Anniversary. On the flight back home from Las Vegas to St. Louis the American Airlines Flight Attendants were soliciting passengers to apply for a Barclay Credit Card. The flight attendants| in an effort to entice passengers to apply for the card| told the passengers if they apply for the card and their respective applications is approved| they will receive bonus points that translate into 2 round-trip tickets anywhere in the continental United States with no black-out dates. Be advised that this is and not accurate at all. On 2 separate occasions we attempted to redeem our round-trip tickets only to be advised we do not have enough points. We initially tried to book a flight from St. Louis to St. Augustine Florida and were told each ticket costs 50|000 points one-was for total of 200|000 points. We then tried to book a flight from St. Louis to Chicago to attend a graduation this coming June. Again we were give the same identical story about each ticket costing 50|000 points one-way for a total of 200|00 points needed to fly to Chicago. I contacted American Airlines and was told we must have misunderstood what the flight attendant was saying. We did not misunderstand anything. American Airlines refuses to stand by the promises made by their flight attendants. So do not fall for their ploy if you fly on their airline.

R Sanyal,United States,2nd March 2020,demonstrated a welcome degree of efficiency and accommodation,American upgraded me to "first" class for the entire journey from Fargo to New York via Chicago. The plane from Fargo to Chicago was an Embraer jet with a 1-2 seating layout. I had no one in the accompanying seat. It was a smooth flight. The best part| of course| of having a seat in the front of the plane| is priority boarding| and thus access to dedicated overhead luggage bins. No inflight entertainment on this aircraft. Variety of alcoholic drinks offered repeatedly along with a basket of packaged snacks. The flight was on schedule. My connecting flight was a couple of hours away but there was a flight departing before that to New York. The gate agent placed me on standby and I made it. But now I was in economy! With time being more precious| I forgoed the later dinner first class flight. The flight I was on was packed. I had to hold on to my jacket on my lap - the overhead bins were fully stashed| and I was given a window seat though I would have preferred an aisle. Flight attendant was solicitous and we were offered a snack and drink. Again| the flight arrived on time and we disembarked rather quickly.

Kristy Clack,United States,1st March 2020,pack a hefty carry on, Cancun to Phoenix. Oddly enough we were offered money for our seats last night from Phoenix to Boise. We declined for a reason! We were moved to the very back of the flight from Cancun to Phoenix and we were the last ones off the plane. Then we were required to go through check again. We were "randomly" chosen for all our bags to be inspected| taking their own sweet time. Then strangely enough the door closed before we could board. Conveniently selling our seats to an over booked flight that had all our luggage on it. I wont ever take another flight by American Airlines. And since we were moved to the back of the plane| we had a choice of 3 beverages and pretzels. My husband asked for a Dr. Pepper and the attendant laughed and said "dont sit in the back anymore!" Thank you for showing me what an airline shouldn't do! We received hotel and restaurant vouchers to a local hotel. Upon arriving it took us 45 minutes to check in because the voucher was incorrect. We had 30 minutes to eat and with no surprise ... they give you 12.00 to spend on a menu that has very few items under 12.00. If you fly with American Airlines| pack a hefty carry on with all your essential needs inside!

Regina Smith,United States,1st March 2020,rude and a complete waste of money, Denver to Miami. I'd like to know what happened to flying first class in general? When I boarded and "tried" to sit in seat 1A it was covered in melted chocolate and then a new pillow was just laid on top of it.  I did get 2 quarters and the leftover chocolate bar I'm assuming was a "on to the next" gift. So when we asked our designated attendant for something to clean he handed us a crumpled napkin and then asked us to put our bags up before we lose out on space. I'm not a primadonna by any means but for $2500 for a ticket that is the exact same as the seats for $400 tends to annoy a person. How about America airlines wipes off their own seats before the next person? Especially during a Corona virus outbreak.

S Yerdon,United States,1st March 2020,surprised at the level of attentiveness, Rochester to Nashville via Philadelphia. American Airline employees were outstanding during our trip. We requested assistance for my mother who uses a walker and were happily surprised at the level of attentiveness and promptness received. We have flown United and Delta with identical service requests and have always had to wait for a wheelchair transfer between gates| even so much as having to find our own wheelchair. From ticketing to boarding and transfers an American employee was there. To top off this trip when we arrived at our final destination the brake handle on the walker had been accidentally broken. We went to baggage services and were provided with a brand new walker (same model). This was more than we expected. I was only hoping to receive a replacement part. American Airlines has gone over and above with customer service. If you need travel assistance I highly recommend American.

For two people we just had one suitcase and we paid $30 dollars| but not just that| after they provided me the weight which was 56 lbs they said it was going to be $100 dollars more which is ridiculous| two people one suitcase that was it. I didn’t bring with us smaller suitcases for carry on inside the flight because I didn’t have| so I thought maybe will be better just one for both of us. I had to take the 6 lbs out of the suitcase.

However AA is the only airline that has flights in and out of Lynchburg Virginia. The last time I flew with them they broke my checked bag and refused to believe they broke it| they caused me to miss a flight because we sat on the Tarmac for 30 minutes after that flight already being delayed. They proceeded to tell me I should have booked a flight with a longer lay over in CLT. This is one of many times they have delayed a flight before I ever even made it to the airport.

Christian Ash,United States,25th February 2020,this airline is poor, To be honest| this airline is poor. I've flown American a few times| and tried quite hard to be understanding. But consistent delays| mismanagement| and employee incompetence paired with low quality flights and no acknowledgement from customer service or staff besides a boiler plate apology every time they screw up(which is often) has driven me to conclude that this airline is not worth your money. Take for example| my last flight. Every single one of my planes with the exception of the return trip from Ontario to Dallas had a delay| all of which took from 30 minutes to 2 hours. 2 due to an utter lack of any communication between staff. They did gate changes with very little notification almost causing some to miss their flights. They boarded planes that had preexisting maintenance problems which caused a severe delay| and their staff are incredibly surly| careless| and disinterested with very few exceptions.

F Dominick,Canada,24th February 2020,not take customer service seriously, Ottawa to San Jose via Philadelphia. From the beginning even before my journey started I had issues. American Airlines changed my flight schedule without informing me. The departure time was the same but all the connections where different as well as the arrival time. I didn’t let that bother me since they were small changes. Once I left Canada I landed in Philadelphia at 730am. I had a 7h layover at the Philadelphia airport. 3 hours into the layover| I heard an announcement saying that the flight was delayed do to maintenance. At that point| I proceeded to the American customer service desk. A gentleman greeted me asking what the problem was. I started explaining that my flight was delayed and it might have an impact on my connecting flights. In addition| I was meeting a friend in Costa Rica and it was important I arrive on January 21st. He looked at my itinerary and informed me that I will need to stay the night in Philadelphia and leave for Costa Rica in the morning| since I would not be able to make my connection flight from Miami To Costa Rica. I was floored! He had no empathy for my situation. At that point| I started talking to one of his coworkers and she started digging into additional solutions. She managed to book me a flight with two connections but it was going to be a close call. I took what she gave me and thanked her! Running to my connections was not easy but I was able to make all the flights and arrive at my destination on time. Looking back at this| I can’t believe one of the American Airline employees tried to take the easy way out and keep me overnight. Upon my arrival I see no bags. I had to wait in San Jose for a day for my bags. No apologies or compensation were provided by the airline.  All in all I would give American Airline two thumbs down| a 0/10. This airline does not take customer service seriously and when you need help they will do the bare minimum to help.

K Berden,United States,23rd February 2020,It was horrible!, Lexington to Charlotte. I had a truly horrible experience with AA a few weeks ago. I was flying economy| so was at the back of the plane. I asked if this could be changed because I have a migraine disability and being near the engine noise exacerbates this condition. I was told no at ticketing| but told it could be possible at the gate. My father's funeral was the previous day| and I was with my son| so I forgot about asking at the gate. once I got on the plane| I tried to speak with the stewardess about the situation. I have never been treated so aggressively rudely in my life. She made it very clear that I was a nuisance from the beginning. We ended up stuck on the runway for two hours because it was Sunday and they had to call in a crew (they weren't already at the airport) to remove a plane blocking the runway with a flat tire. I tried to explain to the stewardess about my disability and asked if I could sit in one of the many empty seats at the front| in order to alleviate the extra noise and heat of sitting in the back--triggers for the disease. She yelled at me| created a scene| refused to respond when I pushed the overhead button so that I could get rid of the needle and syringe I had to use because of the stress her behavior caused me. After two hours of sitting on the tarmac| we taxied back to the gate and I was removed for being "disruptive". I couldn't believe it! Because of this aggressive| nasty| devoid-of-compassion stewardess| I was seven extra hours en-route to my destination! When I complained to the airlines| they basically said "too bad". If the stewardess doesn't like you| they can label you "disruptive" and have you removed! Was she taking something out on me? Was it bad day for her (consider my situation with my father)? I have no idea| and the Airlines refused to take responsibility! I will do my utmost never to fly with company again because of this women.

Marty B Buddenbohn,United States,20th February 2020,awful service with American, Knoxville to Charlotte. For starters this has to be the smallest plane. A full grown child would have difficulty being comfortable. The main reason for my review is the awful service with American. This is not my first time flying with AA and each time it is always a nightmare. Unfortunately| to get from A to B there is no other option. You would think after the recent incident last year and being in the news with physically removing a person from the plane that there would be efforts and strides to improve their service. I have not found this to be the case. In my most recent incident| we are running on a delay leaving very little to no time to catch my connecting flight. While still sitting on the tarmac I politely asked the stewardess if I could move to one of the many empty seats ahead of me in an effort to deplane faster and hopefully make my connecting flight. Her response was of| well| those seats cost extra money and no you cannot move. Now| mind you we're fully planed and sitting here. She goes onto say| if you miss your flight I'm sure they'll reschedule you for another flight. Really? That's your answer.

P Snyder,United States,18th February 2020,humiliated and blamed,Chicago to Salt Lake City. Horrible customer service! The only reason I am flying this airline is that they have a tie-up with Qatar Airways.

After my international flight from Qatar| I asked American Airlines twice to change my boarding pass to an American Airlines one| but was said that I do not need to as I already have seat assigned. Despite that while boarding| the attendant screamed that my ticket is not scanning because I do not have seat assigned. After showing her that it is in fact assigned| she just screamed: "Well it changed".

Katherine Ohara,United States,17th February 2020,never flying American again, Worst experience of my life. I understand the airline does not control the weather; however| American can certainly control my experience and they fell short in every way. First| the American employees at DC airport were unprofessional| rude| and not knowledgeable. The communication re: status of our delayed/canceled flights was nonexistent and when they did communicate| it was always inaccurate information. A staff member literally walked away in the middle of “helping me” trying to get on standby for a flight to Nashville| stating to his coworker “what’s the point| the flight is full and there’s already 5 people on standby in front of her” and stormed off with not a word said to me. I could go on for hours about the incredibly rude American Airlines staff at the DC airport but I would run out of characters. 2nd| due to our canceled flight and the weather| AA was not able to get us a flight to our destination of Nashville but instead was only able to get us on a flight to an airport 120 miles way from our original airport destination| causing us the need to rent a car for $200 and drive 2 hours. For myself and my fiancé both being loyal AA flyers| AA advantage members| and AA barclay credit card holders| you would think at the very least AA would comp us the cost of the rental car for not getting us to our destination. Instead I was met with “no it’s not our fault.” Then| our original flight we were 1st class &our flight we got changed to we were coach. Again| no compensation. To top it all off| they lost my fiancee's checked luggage. Again| I am well aware the airline does not control the weather but I expected so much more from them and they dropped the ball every step of the way. When we get home from this vacation my fiancé and I will both be canceling our AA barclay credit cards and never flying American again after this experience.,None,Couple Leisure,First Class,Providence to Nashville,February 2020,1,1,1,1,None,1,1,1,no
C James,Canada,17th February 2020,will never be flying American again,Toronto to Dallas via Guadalajara. If I could give American Airlines 0 stars I would. We arrived to Toronto early to ensure we made our 6:30 AM flight. We were stuck on the tarmac for deicing| we thought this was no big deal and we took off. Midflight in we realized we might miss our flight to Guadalajara. In flight| they had no information about connecting flights| which I have experienced on other airlines. Upon landing in Dallas we learned we in fact missed our flight and were directed to customer service. At this point we were told to call a number whilst in line| however| they told us that we should go to the counter anyway so that was a waste of a phone call. We get to the counter and they put us on standby for a flight out later that evening and booked us on a flight for the following day guaranteed. We asked about a hotel voucher because it appeared we were delayed due to waiting for deicing in Toronto. However| we were told that it was due to "long lines at U.S customs". We do not believe this as the flight door did close at the scheduled time. We wait for hours in Dallas and make it to the gate. We were told the flight was full| but they would have more information after boarding. Midway through boarding| we were informed there was a mechanical issue with the plane| everyone had to migrate to another terminal to grab another plane. The boarding process began again. When it came to standby everyone got on except for myself and my husband as there was only one seat left. My husband became visibly upset and they just stared at us with "we just need a yes or no". We get that it is beyond our control| but we just wanted some compassion. We were rudely directed back to customer service. We went and pleaded for a hotel voucher and were just given a blank stare and once again told there is nothing the airline can do to help us. We missed a day of our vacation and were out $200 for a hotel. All in all| the staff were not helpful and we just wished that we got an apology.

B Murben,United States,16th February 2020,never again will I fly American, Pensacola  to South Bend via Charlotte. I booked a trip to Pensacola with my niece who was turning 18. I wanted to spend time with her prior to her going to college! Didn’t think our time would be spent in airports or on the plane. On the way there we had a connecting flight to Dallas which then took us to Pensacola. We ran into flight delays| flight cancellations| missed flights| to not getting on standby flights! It was a mess to put it lightly. South Bend people were not helpful and were a bit rude. When we got to Dallas| staff was extremely unhelpful and rude. She told me that she was in the middle of something and I would have to go elsewhere. The other staff were extremely helpful and they should lead a training on customer service. Toni who worked 33d on 2-13-2020 was extremely nice as well. The rest of the workers should be fired. After spending 15 hours in airports and on a plane I didn’t have much energy to complain so I settled for a standby flight for in the morning which we didn’t catch. We ended up catching the mid afternoon flight so we lost a day and 1/2 of our vacation. On the way home our flight was delayed due to the flight crew not having enough hours so instead of 7:27 take off it was 7:50. We get to Charlotte however| our plan needed maintenance so there was yet another delay. They change us to a different plane which also needed maintenance so we got switched to a 3rd plane. This plane was from the 70’s and I prayed we would make it to South Bend. We did but never again will I fly American Airlines.

B Schreier,United States,15th February 2020,never fly with them again, Omaha to Key West via Chicago . They delayed our flight into Chicago for weather which is understandable but they told us they would hold our connecting flight to Key West from Chicago. We got to the gate and they were just closing the gate to the flight and wouldn’t let us on. It took customer service 2 hours to get us on a different flight to Fort Myers. We ended up waiting in Chicago for 6 hours for the flight. We finally get to fort Myers and they sent our luggage to key west. We call to key west and they won’t even deliver our luggage to the hotel or anything. No refund of any kind. We spent about an extra $1200 to cover the mess up. Not happy at all and will never fly with them again.,None,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Key West via Chicago ,February 2020,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,no
Blanche Mukendi,United States,14th February 2020,hellish and nightmarish experience, Nashville to Montreal via NYC / Charlotte. This is my second trip within 6 months with American Airlines and I'm disgusted. My first trip was taken in August of 2019 (same route BNA->Montreal) and between 3 aircraft issues and 5 delayed flights| which caused missed connections| what t was suppose to be a 5hr trip into a 24 hour one with delayed baggage (I received my luggage the next day after calling all night). My second time flying with this airline (I honestly don't know why they are still in business). The first flight had engine oil issues .. but they kept us in there while they fixed it. Between that and other issues| we were delayed for 3 hours while seated in the flight. Then| they reassured us that connections would not be missed| because it's winter and everyone is delayed. We made it from Nashville| TN to Charlotte| NC| missed the connection (go figure)| and put on another connection through LGA (NYC). Flight delayed (again). This time because they were waiting on the flight attendants (seems like the same sequence of excuses used 6 months ago) and when we arrived in NYC missed the connection.  I go see customer service| and they inform me that the next (and last) flight of the day| was full. But they put me on" Priority" Standby. I went to the gate 4 hours early| 2 hours before the flight| gate changed. Went to the changed gate 2 hours early and waited. When their agents arrived at the desk I explained my situation and asked them to verify if there was space| the guy at the counter told me this "You're on standby and you will be the last one to board". I told him that I understood this| but I was also placed on "Priority standby" and he replies "well| they might have told you that at the other desk| but you're not important enough to be on priority standby. There are currently 8 people who are more important and they've been placed in from of you .. you're number 8.| the last person and the flight is full| so good luck!". I bought my ticket| it was never a standby ticket. This type of ugliness and unprofessional behavior is uncalled for. In the brink of tears I waited. The flight boarded and I watched it leave without me. Went back to the desk to be given a viable solution and conveniently enough| their computers were frozen. I sat down in the area and waited (18hrs spent in the airport )| I turned around a few minutes later and They had all left.  I bought a greyhound ticket and road 8 hours into Montreal (with my checked luggage still in North Carolina). A hellish and nightmarish experience| for the second time. Shame on me for even wasting my trust on this airline. Flight attendants have horrible attitudes| agents are rude and curt| and customer service is zero help. And the cherry on top was the unmitigated gall of that agent to talk to any person the way he did to me. Take this airline at your own risk| should you want your sanity tested.

Tina Erickson,United States,14th February 2020,American refused to compensate me, Philadelphia to Orlando. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I was scheduled to fly to Orlando on 2/6 to attend the UCA High School Cheer Nationals and see my daughter (who is a Senior) compete for the final time. My flight was cancelled because the originally scheduled flight crew did not have enough flight hours left. Because American does not have a business continuity plan in place with stand-by flight crews| they had to cancel the flight. They had no other flights available forcing me to book a much more expensive flight with another airline. In turn| I missed my daughter's competition. American refused to compensate me for the added expense I had to incur because of their failure. They refused to offer me anything more than $100 voucher or 5000 points for the fact I missed my daughter's competition - they even made it sound like they were doing me a favor. What am I supposed to do with that?! That gets me nothing. They also refused to compensate me for the hotel cost for the night I lost in Orlando. I am completely unsatisfied with their handling of this situation and told them so. They just don't care. I even asked the person I spoke with if this would satisfy her and she said it would not. I do acknowledge it was a rainy day and weather delays are out of their control but we could have flown if a flight crew was available. We even boarded the plane before they cancelled the flight.

We weren’t let off the airplane until 6:30 because a plane was disabled at the gate we needed to get to. Missed my connecting flight and it was 100% the fault of the airline. Wasn’t provided with any hotel room or accommodations (the next flight they could put me on was 11 am the next morning); told they couldn’t do anything because it was put in the system that everything was weather related| which was completely false| it was because there was an airplane at our gate.

Laurie Oliver,United States,13th February 2020,avoid flying American, American Airlines is dishonest. I purchased a first class ticket from Denver to Savannah- one stop in Charlotte. Getting there| while hardly a first class experience was adequate. The return flight was another story. American booked the connection from Savannah to Charlotte too close to the Denver connection| and due to their known incompetence| sat on the tarmac while my flight to Denver left. The next flight was a 3.5 hour wait in a jammed airport| and the extremely rude customer service agent informed me that there were no 1st class seats to accomodate the Denver route (longest leg of the flight). So| not only did they overbook| but they were unwilling to work on getting me the seat I had paid for| a month before the trip. The only seats left were middle row rear. Incompetent. The first class round trip ticket was $683. l was refunded a total of $110. for the error on their part- this was for the downgrade only. Now| l'm not a genuis| but 110. for the longest leg is absurd- the American Eagle rattletrap that got us from Savannah to Charlotte offered a bag of chips and| if desired| a drink- that's their "first class".

B Torweski,United States,8th February 2020,Never flying with them again, Washington to Phoenix. American Airlines hires the most unprofessional people. It seems like every encounter with anyone who works at American is hostile.

Olsi Odobashi,United States,7th February 2020,getting progressively worse, Chicago to Los Angeles. Generally the inflight service they provide is pretty great. Friendly flight attendants| good meals| etc. The problems crop up before or after the flight. Starting with the ticket purchase process - at some point I was able to choose the seat when purchasing even the cheapest tickets| but that's not the case anymore. Now you can pay more upfront to get the seat option| pay for an "upgrade" while checking in| or just get assigned a random seat after check in.  I've almost exclusively flown American since moving to the US| and one thing that happens pretty consistently is baggage space. When boarding almost every flight| they will announce the overhead bins are full so passengers (in the last few groups) are either "forced" to check-in their carryons or use bins from 5 rows behind their seat| thus blocking the (ridiculously narrow) path and making the boarding process even more chaotic than it already is. And lastly| the reason I even took the effort to write this| customer support (or lack of). If you ever need to call AA for anything| be prepared to speak Robot in order to navigate its futuristic AI conversation engine. And it may seem like it's meant to keep you from speaking to an actual human| but at least it accepts voice input| and what more can I ask from my airline of choice? I don't really know if any of this applies to other airlines as well| but it feels like the service they provide is getting progressively worse!

The rule is door closes 10 min before departure. The plane had already pushed back. The gate team tried to explain that their policy is to close 15 min early vs AAs standard. Given that the flight had pushed back| even their statement seems unbelievable. I am a silver on Delta and they called me when I was running late in Philly. Similar situation. Exhausted with AA.

S Hakinsey,United States,29th January 2020,lost my trust on American Airlines, Charlotte to San Francisco. American Airlines caused me to stay at the airport overnight to wait for the next flight. My first flight to LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) was delayed multiple times| totaling 1 hour of wait. Then| the plane take off was delayed by 30 minutes. All of this made my connection to SFO tighter. When we landed| I had a 30 minute window to catch the connection| but then there was another 1 hour long wait inside the plane which was supposedly going to be "5 minutes" according to the pilot. Even more| after I flew and got off the second| rescheduled flight| I found out my bag was put in another plane arriving in SFO at a later time| which meant 2 hours of bag delay. All these troubles totally messed up my arrival schedule and plans| and I lost my trust on American Airlines (AA) as this is the second time it is happening.

S Pell,United States,28th January 2020,Atrocious customer service, San Jose to Eugene via Los Angeles. One of the worst travel experiences in 45 years:  Atrocious customer service from start to finish.  Inept| rude| and unresponsive management that avoids responsibility for poor service| which is mirrored by unsupported front line personnel| translating to a company that simply doesn’t care.  Delays of more than 4 hours for a 2 hour flight with no weather/disaster excuse... is inexcusable. Management knew| yet kept everyone (50 people ages 4 months-84 years) waiting with consecutive delays totaling 4 hours before cancelling flight....at 1 AM in the morning| leaving us stranded in the middle of the night with very limited rebook options within the next 12 hours.

Every time I fly them something happens .. delays| cancellations| rude employees. This latest event happened when a flight from Charlotte was delayed due to air traffic at the Charlotte airport we were headed to. We left 30 mins late and then circled the Charlotte airport for another extra 15 mins. More than half the plane missed their connections. When I finally got off my commuter plane I ran (a mile it seemed) to catch my connection. I had 15 mins before it was due to take off. I arrived at the gate to find they had closed the flight (plane still there) and I wouldn't be allowed to board. I asked them why they didn't hold the plane knowing I was a delayed flight. I was told that no one contacted them to tell them to hold it. WTF! I'm so tired of American having. No regard for travelers plans. This doesn't happen with other airlines!

When I got back home I called customer service and it took three different times of me calling to get them to give me some kind of compensation. They kept on giving me a phone number to call them back that did NOT work. Finally they gave me a $250 voucher that expires in a year. I paid a lot of money for this ticket for the experience and they blew me off with $250 dollars. The stewardess on the plane was very nice and understanding. Customer service is another story.

T Broussard,United States,20th January 2020,really needs to do better, Los Angeles to Syracuse via Charlotte. There is always an issue when you fly with American Airlines! Since my son’s initial flight at LAX is delayed| he will definitely miss his connecting flight at ORD. Therefore he will most likely miss the important event he was trying to attend in the first place. When my son asked for an alternate flight| he was not even helped at American Airlines customer service; instead he was given a phone number to call and make the new travel arrangements himself. When he called| the service representative told him he would have to wait overnight and take a flight out 24 hours later. These flights that we have previously paid for months in advance| are usually cancelled or postponed| especially on the return flights. It definitely seems like false advertisement when an airline promotes and sells seats on flights for specific dates and times| and then cancel| only so they can cram as many passengers together on one plane as possible. And to make matters worse| my son’s luggage has been loaded on the plane that he cannot even take. We are “told” that he can pick up his luggage when he eventually arrives at his destination| whenever and wherever that is! Airlines such as this one rarely live up to their promises| and they aren’t the least bit concerned in how they greatly inconvenience their passengers.

David Gunn,United States,19th January 2020,A truly uncomfortable flight, A truly uncomfortable flight. Because of the short connecting time I paid for a preferred seat nearer the front.

I got to spent a full 5+ hours with someones head in my lap as she left the seat reclined even when not sleeping; and had to be prompted to put in in the landing position! The leg room situation was a joke; no space at all. The seat was probably a bit wider; a good thing because I had to sit sideways to clear the magazines.

A month after paying a significant amount for these tickets I get an email informing me our departure time was moved to 5:11 am and our return flight that was set for afternoon was moved to 10:00 eliminating any time to enjoy the last day with no discount to our price. We did our best to make it work and at the check in kiosk it didn't allow an option to check back .. apparently we missed the 45 minute limit by a minute. The rude attendant by the time we got her attention said there was nothing she could do we needed to hope we could rebook a later flight. Later we found out this was not true and the attendants at the desk could have checked our luggage up to 30 minutes before which she did not tell us. I ran up to the airport store bought a carry on bag| through what we could in| ran suitcase back to car| and ran to gate as fast as you can with a 6 and 8 year old. As we got there they told us we could not board and the plane was gone .. although it could be clearly seen outside the window. On top of that was the continued most unfriendly customer service experience i've been through in years......couldn't care less and you were lucky they would acknowledge you. Luckily they found us another flight ... 12 hours later and charged us an additional $300 to save those seats.

This was over 10 hours of air travel. Not only were our original seats not together (completely unheard of on other airlines) but there were not even two seats together available for the additional charges if picking a seat.
